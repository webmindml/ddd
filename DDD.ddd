Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software development focusing on creating shared understanding of the domain problem between developers and domain experts. DDD provides a set of principles and practices to help design and build complex software systems to accurately reflect the real-world domain they are intended to model. 

key concepts in Domain-Driven Design:

Domain: The domain refers to the problem space or subject area that the software aims to address including relevant concepts, rules, and relationships defining the business or application domain.

Ubiquitous Language: DDD promotes the use of common, shared vocabulary, between developers and domain experts. This "ubiquitous language" ensures that both parties have a clear and consistent understanding of domain concepts, reducing misunderstandings and communication gaps.

Entities: Entities are objects in the domain with a distinct identity that remains consistent throughout their lifecycle. Entities are often the core objects around which your application is built. For example, in an e-commerce system, a "Product" entity is represented as a physical or digital item for sale.

Value Objects: Value objects are objects that have no distinct identity but are defined by their attributes. Value Objects are immutable and represent concepts or measurements. For instance, a "Money" value object encapsulates currency and amount.

Aggregates: Aggregates are clusters of related entities and value objects treated as a single unit. Aggregates ensure consistency and encapsulation within a boundary, allowing changes to be managed and validated as a whole.

Repositories: Repositories provide a way to retrieve and store aggregates from and to a data store. Repositories shield the rest of the application from the details of data access and storage.

Services: Services encapsulate domain logic that does not naturally fit within the context of a single entity or value object. Services orchestrate interactions between aggregates or perform complex operations.

Domain Events: Domain events represent significant occurrences or state changes within the domain. Domain Events are used to communicate changes and trigger actions in other parts of the system.

Bounded Contexts: Bounded contexts define explicit boundaries within which a particular model and ubiquitous language apply. Different bounded contexts can have different interpretations of the same terms. Bounded contexts help manage complexity and enable teams to work on specific parts of the system independently.

Context Mapping: Context mapping is the practice of defining relationships and communication patterns between different bounded contexts ensuring that different parts of the system work together cohesively.

Aggregates: Aggregates are clusters of related entities and value objects that are treated as a single unit. Aggregates ensure consistency and encapsulation within a boundary, allowing changes to be managed and validated as a whole.

These DDD concepts and principles, when applied effectively, help create software systems more aligned with the underlying domain, easier to understand, and maintainable over time. When designing an abstraction library like DDD for WebGPU, you would adapt these principles to the specific needs and characteristics of the graphics programming domain and the WebGPU API.
